# Meet the 2025 Steering Committee  

In TODO, it is the community of participants who drive TODO project initiatives, while the Steering Committee acts as a support body, streamlining processes to ensure quality contributions and helping the community get work done. Today, we are delighted to announce the new members who will join in 2025.  

## 2025 Steering Committee Elections  

Each year, the Steering Committee holds elections, with members serving two-year terms. The SC comprises both elected and appointed seats. This year, we had one elected and two appointed seats to fill.  

### (Returning Member) Georg Kunz - Elected  
An Open Source Advocate at Ericsson’s OSPO, Georg contributes to various open source communities, including OpenStack, Linux Foundation Networking, and OpenSSF. 
He has served on the Technical Steering Committee of the Anuket project and the TODO Group and co-chares the OpenSSF Best Practices Working Group.  

### (Returning Member) Annania Melaku - Appointed  
As a Technical Program Manager and Open Source Strategist with the NGINX Community Team at F5, Annania has led initiatives that promote collaboration and best 
practices within the open source ecosystem. Her previous roles include foundational work in the F5 Open Source Program Office (OSPO) and leadership in Comcast’s OSPO, 
where she developed automated solutions for open source license compliance.  

### (New Member) Natali Vlatko - Appointed  
Serving as an Open Source Architect at Cisco, Natali specializes in open software, policy, and governance. She co-chairs the SIG Docs for Kubernetes and previously 
founded and led the OSPO at Wayfair, earning recognition as a Top End User by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation in 2023. Natali has also contributed to program 
committees for several open source conferences.  

These new members, along with those who joined in 2024—Ashley Wolf, Stephen Augustus, Nik Peters, and Brittany Istenes—will support the community in 2025 by driving progress, ensuring that TODO’s strategic goals align with our mission, building partnerships with peer open source communities, and adapting to the challenges of the profession.  

## Outgoing Steering Committee Members  

As we welcome new members to the 2025 Steering Committee, we also take a moment to express our heartfelt gratitude to those who are concluding their roles, including 
**Leslie Hawthorn**.  

During her time on the Steering Committee, Leslie contributed significantly by:  
- Developing processes and documentation to support the community  
- Resolving community requests and fostering a collaborative environment  
- Helping define the strategic goals of the TODO Group  

On behalf of the TODO community, we extend our deepest thanks to Leslie for her invaluable stewardship in the TODO Steering Committee.

## Process and Results Breakdown  

The Steering Committee Election took place in mid-October, and anyone could become a candidate by submitting an application form that closed in early October. The form was shared via community mailing lists, Slack, and social media. 
Participation was open to all, and more information can be found in the [TODO governance repo](https://github.com/todogroup/governance).  

Voting contacts from TODO Group members cast their votes via a [CIVS system poll](https://civs1.civs.us/) during November. Anonymized results were made available to TODO general memebrs, and the elected SC member was notified.

For appointing members, the current 2024 SC voted using the same CIVS system in a separate poll for the remaining candidates from the 2025 list. 
The following criteria were considered:  

1. **Diversity**: Gender, geographical, and organizational diversity within the current SC, and how the new member would contribute to it  
2. **Experience and Skills**: Areas where the current SC may lack expertise or need additional support, particularly those important for the 2025 goals and focus areas, such as project and community management, communications, website development, and more  
3. **Engagement and Leadership**: Knowledge, engagement, and leadership roles in TODO initiatives over the past year
