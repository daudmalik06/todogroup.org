The **State of OSPOs and Open Source Management 2024** report highlights the evolving role of OSPOs (Open Source Program Offices) and similar initiatives 
in driving the effective integration of open source management across diverse specializations and sectors, including security, AI infrastructure, and beyond. It also provides an in-depth analysis of the gap between expectations and realities in establishing an OSPO, offering insights for organizations at 
different stages of their OSPO journey.

## Open Source Management and Effective Cross-Skilling

### üîê Security Management 

**91% of OSPOs are involved in managing security issues.** This shows the role OSPOs play in bridging security and open source management. By fostering collaboration‚Äî such as through initiatives like the [OpenSSF](https://openssf.org) ‚Äî OSPOs enhance the ability of organizations to address security challenges.

### ü§ñ GenAI Infrastructure  
**84% of OSPOs are involved in managing GenAI infrastructure.**  OSPOs are becoming integral partners in digital transformation efforts, especially in the adoption and management of Generative AI (GenAI) technologies. Their involvement ensures that open source management practices align with emerging AI infrastructure needs, supported by efforts like the [LF AI & Data Foundation](https://lfaidata.foundation).

### üöÄ Community Engagement  
**80% of organizations report that their OSPOs have a meaningful impact on their ability to collaborate with open source communities.**  This highlights the importance of OSPOs in fostering long-term, healthy relationships with the open source projects organizations depend on. Their focus on collaboration and transparency strengthens these critical connections

## Adoption Challenges and Growth Opportunities

**77% of large organizations have an OSPO,** while only **19% of small organizations do.** These figures reveal a gap not only in adoption rates but also in how the OSPO and dedicated satff involved in Open Source Management is used:

- Larger organizations focus on leveraging their use of open source to mitigate risk, stay current with industry trends and practices, and align with broader policy objectives
- Smaller organizations, on the other hand, prioritize developing an open source strategy, executing that strategy, and implementing processes and best practices to guide their efforts effectively

## Addressing the Expectations-Reality Gap  

The anticipated benefits of establishing an OSPO often set high expectations for companies, particularly regarding accelerating product development, 
fostering internal collaboration, and increasing influence in the open source community. However, the reality frequently falls short of these expectations.

The report delves into the gap between the expectations and realities of establishing an OSPO and investing in open source management. Identified challenges include: 

- Return on Investment (ROI): Difficulty in demonstrating clear ROI often leaves stakeholders questioning the business value of an OSPO
- Misunderstanding the Value of Open Source: A lack of understanding about OSS benefits can lead to underutilization or resistance from leadership 
- Competing Priorities: OSPOs may struggle to secure resources and attention amidst other organizational goals, slowing open source management impact and effectiveness in the organization's units
